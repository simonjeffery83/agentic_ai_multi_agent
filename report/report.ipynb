    "# Munder Difflin Multi-Agent System: Simple Project Report\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. How the System Works\n",
    "\n",
    "We built this system like a small office with a manager and two specialized workers. This \"Manager-Worker\" setup stops any one part of the code from getting overwhelmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Team:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The Manager (Orchestrator)**: This is the \"brain.\" It reads what the customer wants and decides which worker should handle the job.\n",
    "* **The Inventory Worker**: This worker checks the warehouse. They use a tool to see if paper is in stock or if they need to order more from a supplier.\n",
    "* **The Sales Worker**: This worker handles the money. They check past prices to keep things fair and record every sale in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Testing Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Tested the system with 20 different customer requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Went Well\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Smart Planning**: The agents were smart enough to realize that if a customer wanted paper in 2025, but the supplier couldn't deliver until 2026, they should warn the customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Needs Fixing\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The date Error**: When recording sales, the system used the actual current date (2026) instead of the \"simulation\" date (2025). This made the financial reports look like nothing was happening in 2025.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. How to Make it Better\n",
    "\n",
    "To get this ready for real-world use, I recommend these changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fix the Dates**: Change the tools so the agents can log a sale on a specific past date instead of just using \"right now\".\n"
